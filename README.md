# Drone Image Processing for GEE and image classification
This repository contains all of the files with Python code and instructions to process drone image JPEGS into TIFF format to facilitate upload into Google Earth Engine. Code and instructions for image classification and accuracy assessment in Google Earth Engine are included. These files are provided as both Jupyter notebooks and PDFs. 

We have also included three drone images of Heron Reef to use as an example for drone image preprocessing and classification.
